# IOChaser Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 2026-01-18

## Overview
IOChaser is a browser extension designed to help users extract and analyze Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) such as IP addresses, domains, hashes, and email addresses directly from webpages.

## Data Processing
IOChaser does **not collect, store, sell, or transmit personal user data** to the developer.

The extension processes **visible webpage content locally in the user’s browser** only when explicitly triggered by the user. This processing is performed solely to identify and extract IOCs from the page.

IOChaser does not use analytics, tracking technologies, fingerprinting, or background data collection.

## API Keys
If users choose to provide API keys (for example, VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, or Have I Been Pwned):
- The keys are stored **locally** using Chrome’s storage API
- The keys are **never transmitted to the developer**
- The keys are used only to query third-party threat intelligence services selected by the user

## Third-Party Services
When a user chooses to analyze an IOC, the extension may send that IOC to third-party services (such as VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, URLScan, or Have I Been Pwned) at the user’s request.  
These interactions are governed by the respective third-party services’ privacy policies.

## Data Sharing
IOChaser does **not** sell, rent, or transfer user data to third parties outside of its core functionality.

## Changes
This privacy policy may be updated if the extension’s functionality changes. Any updates will be reflected in this document.
